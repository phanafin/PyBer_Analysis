#### **PyBer_Analysis**


1.) Overview of the Analysis
  The analysis that I have been tasked with relates to data aquired on behalf of PyBer, a ride shareing company.  The data provided information regarding cities in which PyBer operates, breaking out those cities into types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), the number of driver, the number of rides given, and when those rides were given,in order to see patterns and opportunities for the company.
  
2.) Results
  The first task at hand was to come up with a summary that would clearly show the leadership personel a breakdown of the average dollar values that are atributed to each type of city.  For example, the Rural cities had 125 total rides given by 78 drivers which produced $4,328 in revenue (See Fig. 9 for Total Fare by Type discription).

  With the revenue and Average Fare per Ride, as well as the Average Fare per Driver, the PyBer leadership requested information on Total Fare by City Type over a specific date range (Jan 1, 2019 thru Apr 29, 2019).  The data was analyzed and the results are shown in Figure 8;

  3.) Summary
    As a result of the data analysis and the leaderships desire to allocate resources to the areas of their business that haas the most need, I make the following recommendations;
    a.) Don't be distracted by the size of the average fare in Rural City Types.  Their trips are longer in a rural area and result in higher fares, but their frequency is so small that the segment is far from being a major revenue source for the company.
    b.) However, from a driver point of view, being the the Rural citys is much more lucrative.  The average fare per driver is over $55 versus $17 per driver in Urban areas.  Perhaps the number of drivers in the Urban areas is too saturated.
    c.) Seasonality has little impact on the total fare by city type.  While each type has peaks at various times of the requested date range, none of them differentiate much from the overall dollar amounts.
