#### **PyBer_Analysis**


1.) Overview of the Analysis
  The analysis that I have been tasked with relates to data aquired on behalf of PyBer, a ride shareing company.  The data provided information regarding cities in which PyBer operates, breaking out those cities into types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), the number of driver, the number of rides given, and when those rides were given,in order to see patterns and opportunities for the company.
  
2.) Results
  The first task at hand was to come up with a summary that would clearly show the leadership personel a breakdown of the average dollar values that are atributed to each type of city, shown here;
